# RekKa's Rampage

This is a starter project I did while working on the Unity Junior Programmer Path.
I worked on this during the lab section of the program.

## About the Game

This is an arcade style game where you play as a fire wielding mage that's moving around on a tile
based board trying to stop invading enemies.  

## Installation

I use Unity and these files to be able to build the game.  This was developed with Unity version 2022.3.0f1
